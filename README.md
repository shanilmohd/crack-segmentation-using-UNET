# Crack Detection using U-Net and Length-Width Calculation using OpenCV

This repository contains the code and documentation for a crack detection system based on the U-Net architecture and length-width calculation using OpenCV. The project was completed as part of a research internship at NIT Calicut, where we aimed to develop an efficient and accurate solution for detecting cracks in reinforced concrete structures.

## Project Overview

Cracks in concrete structures can pose significant risks to the structural integrity and safety of buildings. Detecting and assessing these cracks accurately is essential for effective maintenance and repair. This project leverages the power of deep learning with the U-Net architecture to perform precise segmentation of cracks in images. Additionally, we use OpenCV for length and width calculation of the segmented cracks.

## Dataset

The crack detection model is trained on a crack dataset sourced from Kaggle, which contains a diverse set of images depicting cracks in various concrete structures. The dataset has been labeled with ground truth annotations for training and evaluation.

Please find the attached colab notebook.

## Results

The crack detection system based on U-Net demonstrates high accuracy in segmenting cracks from the input images. The length and width calculation using OpenCV provides precise dimensions of the cracks, facilitating better analysis and maintenance decisions.
